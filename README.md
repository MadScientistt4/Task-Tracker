# Kanban Task Tracker

A modern **Kanban-style Task Tracker** built with **React**, featuring drag-and-drop functionality, persistent storage, and a clean dark-themed UI. This app allows users to manage tasks visually by moving them between **Pending** and **Completed** columns — similar to tools like Trello or Notion.

This project was created as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate frontend engineering skills, component-based architecture, and real-world UX patterns.
